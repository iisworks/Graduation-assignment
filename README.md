# Forecasting Spot Exchange Rates 

An exchange rate is a rate at which one currency will be exchanged for another currency and affects trade and the movement of money between countries.
Exchange rates are impacted by both the domestic currency value and the foreign currency value. In July 2022, the exchange rate from U.S. Dollars to the Euro was 1.02, meaning it takes $1.02 to buy â‚¬1.
While most exchange rates are floating and will rise or fall based on the supply and demand in the market, some exchange rates are pegged or fixed to the value of a specific country's currency. Exchange rate changes affect businesses and the cost of supplies and demand for their products in the international marketplace. 
Because of the unpredictability and volatility of currency rates, the exchange rate prediction has become one of the most challenging applications of financial time series forecasting.
